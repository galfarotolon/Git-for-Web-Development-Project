    1. What is Semantic HTML? 
    HTML that gives meaning to our content, such as <nav>, <footer>, <h1>-<h6>.

    2. What is HTML used for? 
    HTML is used to give structure to a web page. It is the "foundations" of the house, where CSS is the decorations/furniture and Javascript is the electricity/plumbing.
    
    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 
    Attributes give additional information to an element, such as a "class" or a "src". These attributes go inside
    of the element tags such as <img src="imagefilehere"> or <div class="exampleClass">.

    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?
    The <h1> tag is normally used for the main header of a web page and should by convention only be used once.

    5. Name two tags that have required attributes
    <input> tags require attributes such as "type", "id", and "name". 
    The <a> tag also normally comes with a hyperlink attribute "href". 

    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 
    We put <!DOCTYPE HTML> to make sure the browser can quickly tell what language our website is written in.
    Then we can put a <head> to include the name/title of the website. This is normally called an HTML "boilerplate"
    as it is always the standard format to include in each html document. A link to an external CSS file is 
    also usually found in the <head> of an HTML document.

    7. What is an id? 
    An id is an unique identifier that helps target elements easily when using CSS and Javascript (DOM). 

    8. What elements can I add an id to? 
    The id attribute can be used on any html element.

    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
    An id is unique and should only be used one time per attribute. Each id should have a different name.  

    10. What is a class? 
    A class is similar to an id in that it helps target style in CSS easily and also in Javascript, but 
    unlike ids that can only be used one time, classes can be used multiple times in different elements. 

    11. What elements can I add a class to? 
    Normally classes are added to <div>s or <section>s but they can be added to any HTML element. 

    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page? 
    Classes do not have restrictions and can be used as many times as necessary. 

    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab?
    To open a link in a new tab one must use the target attribute and make it equal to blank, such as:
    <a href="linktoapicturehere" target=_blank>.

    14. What is the alt attribute used for? 
    the alt attribute is used as a description for an image when it cannot be displayed or to help people
    with disabilities understand it (perhaps the visually impaired). 

    15. How do I reference an id?
    In CSS ids are referenced by adding # followed by the id name:
    #exampleId

    16. What is the difference between a section and a div?
    A section groups pieces of text or information that are relevant to one another, while divs are
    more commonly used to group different information that perhaps has no relevance other than the same
    styling for CSS or JS. 

    17. What is CSS used for? 
    CSS (cascading style sheets) are used to give style to an HTML document. Normally done by adding external
    CSS files to an html file, it can however also be applied in a documents header section or inline with
    the <style> element tag.

    18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page
    This element would be seleced by doing so:
    h2{
        color: green; 
    }

    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one

    An id is an unique identifier and is more specific, making it easier to target one specific element in an
    HTML document. Classes are less specific and can be used freely accross the document to apply similar styles
    to different elements. 

    20. How do we select classes in CSS?
    We select classes by adding a "." in front of the class name:
    .exampleClass{
       
    }

    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””?
    You can select an element of p with a class of "human" like this:
    .human{

    }

    You directly select the class because in this case it is a single class and will only affect that <p>
    element. 

    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful?
    This can be useful when only targeting one element of a parent selector, such as one specific 
    <li> item in an <ul>. 

    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?
    .sidebar{

    }

    24. What is a pseudo selector?
    a pseudo selector is a selector that only applies when something happens, such as a hover over a 
    certain element. 

    25. What do we use the change the spacing between lines?
    example: 

    p{
    line-height: 1.5
    }

    26. What do we use to change the spacing between letters?
    We use: 

    p{
        letter-spacing: 2px;
    }

    27. What do we use to to change everything to CAPITALS? lowercase? Capitalize?
    We use the text-transform property, uppercase, capitalize, lowercase, and several others can be 
    used to alter text without touching the HTML file. 

    28. How do I add a 1px border around my div that is dotted and black?
    {
        border: dotted black 1px;
    }

    29. How do I select everything on the page?
    You can use body if you have all of your page wrapped around the body tags or you can use the
    * selector that selects all the page.  


    30. How do I write a comment in CSS?
    use /* */ and the text in between, or the double front dash //.


    31. How do I find out what file I am in, when I am using the command line?
    pwd 

    32. Using the command line - how do I see a list of files/folders in my current folder?
    ls 

    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this? 
    rm fileName

    34. Why should I use version control? 
    To keep your progress saved and ensure you can go back to a previous version in case your app breaks. 
    Also to let other developers see your problem solving skills and approach to each different version. 

    35. How often should I commit to github?
    Each 20-30 mintues is a good rule of thumb. 

    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github? 
    git push : this uploads all the files to our github account.

    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
    First fork the repository (make sure when you see your name on the top left)
    Then add collaborator (your TL)
    Clone the repository by copying the https link to the command line (first ensure you are in the folder
    you want to use by cd ing into it)
    cd into the newly created repo by entering cd followed by the repo project name
    use git checkout -b "firstname-lastname" to branch from the master branch. 
    Once you start working on assignment, use the git status to see if you need to add any new changes.
    If so, use git add . ( to add all the changes). 
    Then git commit -m "add a comment here with the new changes"- this will save all the progress.
    Then push the changes to the github repo by using git push -u origin firstname-lastname
    When the changes are on gitbhub then proceed with pull request
    Make sure it is the forked repository and not the base one
    Add the TL to the reviewers of the repo and then submit the pull request
    DO NOT MERGE the request (this is done by the TL once he/she has reviewed the repo.)
