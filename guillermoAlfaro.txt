    1. What is Semantic HTML? 
    HTML that gives meaning to our content, such as <nav>, <footer>, <h1>-<h6>.

    2. What is HTML used for? 
    HTML is used to give structure to a web page. It is the "foundations" of the house, where CSS is the decorations/furniture and Javascript is the electricity/plumbing.
    
    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 
    Attributes give additional information to an element, such as a "class" or a "src". These attributes go inside
    of the element tags such as <img src="imagefilehere"> or <div class="exampleClass">.

    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?
    The <h1> tag is normally used for the main header of a web page and should by convention only be used once.

    5. Name two tags that have required attributes
    <input> tags require attributes such as "type", "id", and "name". 
    The <a> tag also normally comes with a hyperlink attribute "href". 

    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 
    We put <!DOCTYPE HTML> to make sure the browser can quickly tell what language our website is written in.
    Then we can put a <head> to include the name/title of the website. This is normally called an HTML "boilerplate"
    as it is always the standard format to include in each html document. A link to an external CSS file is 
    also usually found in the <head> of an HTML document.

    7. What is an id? 
    An id is an unique identifier that helps target elements easily when using CSS and Javascript (DOM). 

    8. What elements can I add an id to? 
    The id attribute can be used on any html element.

    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
    An id is unique and should only be used one time per attribute. Each id should have a different name.  

    10. What is a class? 
    A class is similar to an id in that it helps target style in CSS easily and also in Javascript, but 
    unlike ids that can only be used one time, classes can be used multiple times in different elements. 

    11. What elements can I add a class to? 
    Normally classes are added to <div>s or <section>s but they can be added to any HTML element. 

    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page? 
    Classes do not have restrictions and can be used as many times as necessary. 

    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab?
    To open a link in a new tab one must use the target attribute and make it equal to blank, such as:
    <a href="linktoapicturehere" target=_blank>.

    14. What is the alt attribute used for? 
    the alt attribute is used as a description for an image when it cannot be displayed or to help people
    with disabilities understand it (perhaps the visually impaired). 

    15. How do I reference an id?
    In CSS ids are referenced by adding # followed by the id name:
    #exampleId

    16. What is the difference between a section and a div?
    A section groups pieces of text or information that are relevant to one another, while divs are
    more commonly used to group different information that perhaps has no relevance other than the same
    styling for CSS or JS. 

    17. What is CSS used for? 
    CSS (cascading style sheets) are used to give style to an HTML document. Normally done by adding external
    CSS files to an html file, it can however also be applied in a documents header section or inline with
    the <style> element tag.

    18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page
    This element would be seleced by doing so:
